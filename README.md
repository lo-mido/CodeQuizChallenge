# CodeQuizChallenge
The assignment I had to complete was a code quiz, where I needed to utilize CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to create a responsive interface.

My motivation for undertaking this project was twofold. Firstly, coding assessments are commonly used during interviews to evaluate candidates, and I wanted to ensure that I met the necessary criteria to stand out as a strong candidate. Secondly, I saw this challenge as an opportunity to improve my technical skills and gain confidence in coding, which would be invaluable for future programming roles.

This project aimed to solve the problem of developing a responsive user interface using JavaScript in conjunction with HTML and CSS. By learning and implementing JavaScript effectively, I would enhance my programming capabilities and broaden my understanding of programming languages. This knowledge would open doors to various programming opportunities.

 Throughout the completion of this project, I learned valuable lessons. Firstly, I gained hands-on experience in using CSS and HTML to create visually appealing web applications. Additionally, I deepened my understanding of JavaScript and its role in creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces. The project also served as a stepping stone towards building a portfolio of deployed web applications, which would increase my chances of impressing potential employers.
